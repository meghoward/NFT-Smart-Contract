# NFT-Smart-Contract
Created an on-chain ticketing service for a Principles of Distributed Ledgers module at Imperial.

This service features three core components:
  1. a non-fungible token (NFT) contract for implementing ticket logic,
  2. a primary marketplace that allows users to create tickets (by deploying new instances of an NFT contract) and mint these tickets in exchange for an ERC20 token payment,
  3. a secondary marketplace that allows users to create bids for tickets listed for sale by current ticket holders.
